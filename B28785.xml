            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS Humbly Offered to the High Court of Parliament, To shew the great Dammage the Publick Receives by the Ill Flawing of Raw-Hides and Calves-Skins.</head>
            <p>WHereas by the Statute of the First of King <hi>James</hi> the First, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. Provision is made, against the Ill Flawing of <hi>Raw-Hides,</hi> but by the smallness of the Penalty, being but <hi>Twenty Pence,</hi> and the difficulty of the Prosecution, being by Action of Debt, the same is become Ineffectual.</p>
            <p n="2">II. There is no Provision, by any Law, against the Ill Flawing of <hi>Calves-Skins,</hi> which are now become a great Ware in <hi>Bootes</hi> and <hi>Shoes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Nobillity</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> receive great Dammage in their <hi>Coaches</hi> and <hi>Harnesses,</hi> by their often breaking and receiving wet through the Flaws, which cannot be so well discerned when wrought up.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Commonalty</hi> receive great Dammage, in their <hi>Bootes, Shoes, Bridles</hi> and <hi>Stirrup-Leathers,</hi> by Holes wearing in the Upper-Leathers, and taking Water in the Soles of the <hi>Shoes;</hi> to the Indangering the Healthes of the Wearers: And by the <hi>Bridles</hi> and <hi>Stirrup-Leathers</hi> breaking, Indangering Peoples Lives.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Hereby many <hi>Hides</hi> and <hi>Skins</hi> are Rendred unfit for many Special Uses, which tendes much to the lessening of the Commodity, in the Price thereof, to the value of above One Thousand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> in <hi>Leaden-Hall-Market,</hi> as is ready to be Attested by many Credible Persons. And what must the Dammage then be in all the other Markets in the Kingdome? From several of which there is great Complaints: And all this to the loss of the whole Nation, and Profit to none.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. These Abuses are now become so General, that the Buyers of Leather cannot Buy One Parcel in Ten but what is much Abused thereby, so that they are forced to Work it up into made Wares with these Defects, or else must sustain great Losses.</p>
